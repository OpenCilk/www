Docker Clues

<pre>


Known good platforms: ubuntu 20.04, ubuntu 18.04

Get the docker package (s) (see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
Install docker

Add user to docker group in /etc/group
Check groups : should see docker  (may have to logout and login again!)

mkdir a directory
get the image
get the script

initial pass:
cd directory
./docker.sh init

nth pass:
./docker.sh run

NOTE: You might see an error message like this, when you type
	./docker.sh run

    docker run -it -u=1000:1000 --name opencilk --rm -v /home/xxx/cilk/mtest/tutorial:/tutorial pact2021tutorial:20210927
    groups: cannot find name for group ID 1000
    I have no name!@ef590f4b3de6:/$ 

PLEASE IGNORE THIS ERROR 

cd /tutorial

Editting
 	- maybe edit inside docker image?  YMMV
	- maybe exit from docker image; edit; ./docker.sh run
	- maybe have an extra window:
		cd directory
		do editting

To exit a docker session started by "./docker.sh run" type
	exit
